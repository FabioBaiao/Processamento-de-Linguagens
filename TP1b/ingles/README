Start by opening layout/contractions.html (for instance, "firefox contractions.html");
Write your text, click the button and save the file. If you're using Linux, probably your file will be saved in ~/Downloads/ which is what the program is expecting (yeah, this is bad, I know);
Before clicking any of the links to see the results, go to the folder of the flex program through bash and run the program. Now you're ready to go back to your browser and check the results. This happens because we can't run a local program from a web page for safety reasons (execution of "format c:" when accessing some external site would be funny, right?).
